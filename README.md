Welcome to Teamout! This is a HTML5 mobile app that makes organizing team luncheons easy and fun.

Currently it is hosted on PhoneGap. [Click here](http://build.phonegap.com/apps/665342/share) for the QR code (auto-install) and package binaries (manual-install).

## Future plans

Here are some future platforms that we will consider to use:

- jQuery Mobile - generic theming but quick to use
- KendoUI - costs $200 and above but well polished
- Lungo - limited theming but versatile animation
- Sensha - steep learning curve but worth it

The data source is a JSON file right now but it can be migrated over to a Heroku backend with a REST API.
